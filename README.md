# MONOREPO_PLAYGROUND

This is a repo only for experimental use of trying to understand how lerna and rollup.js work together to generate minimized, high performace JS module in multiple format, for both front-end and back-end. 

## SPECIAL THANKS

This repo inspired by a brilliant Blockchain Project Ethers.js. In fact, the entire admin folder is a simple copy of Ether's project's admin folder. I'll look into the detail and find ways to implement a simplified version of mine. But still, dope project, huge **PP**.
